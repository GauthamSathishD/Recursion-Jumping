# Recursion Jumping

This program simulates a jumping bug using recursion and allows users to control its movement interactively.

## Features

- **Recursive Simulation**: Demonstrates the use of recursion to calculate and control movements.
- **User Interaction**: Users can control the jumping bug's movement parameters dynamically.
- **Sound Effects**: Integrates sound for an engaging experience.
- **Java-Based**: Implemented using Java for cross-platform functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the implementation.
- **Sound Integration**: Enhances the user experience with sound effects.
